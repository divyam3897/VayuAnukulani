## VayuAnukulani: Adaptive Memory Networks for Air Pollution Forecasting


VayuAnukulani is  a  direct  Hindi  translation  for  the  two  key  words  Air  and
Adaptatability - Air,  translated  as  Vayu  and  Adaptatability,  translated  as
Anukulani. We proposed an end-to-end  solution to predict air quality for next 24 hours.

### Idea
We  present a system to  predict  air  quality for  next  24  hours  by  estimating  the  concentration  and  level
of  different  air  pollutants  including  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2), particulate  matter  (PM2.5) and PM10)  for  Delhi.
